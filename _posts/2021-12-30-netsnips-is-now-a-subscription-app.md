My app [NetSnips](https://apps.apple.com/app/id507888242) will soon be 10 years in the App Store - that's quite an age for an app these days.

I've started developing NetSnips, my visual web page tracking app, as a student and used it primarily to check my university web page for new exam results. Soon, I understood that the concept can be used for many other use cases and that‚Äôs why I cleaned it up and published my first own app on the App Store. Long time macOS users will remeber the dashboard and the "Web Clips" widget. NetSnips is similar to this old idea, but optimized for mobile and more customizable.

In 2012 the App Store, and iOS development in general, was very different than these days ([a review from 2012](https://dottech.org/80671/follow-just-snippets-of-a-webpage-with-netsnips-iphone/)). Swift, the programming language, was unknown and small apps by indies could generate a considerable amount of revenue with pay upfront or, fancier, in-app feature unlocks.

Except from the very first year, NetSnips was always a so-called freemium app. You could use the app with two web snippets for free, but if you wanted more, yozu had to buy the ‚ÄúUnlimited Snippets‚Äù upgrade. This worked reasonably well in the first years of NetSnips lifetime, especially because there were considerably less apps on the App Store and I could make enough revenue from new customers to work on maintenance and feature updates for all users.

However, let's face it: NetSnips is a niche app for a small audience that care about visual web page tracking. You either have a specific use case for it or you won‚Äôt find it useful at all. I still find it fascinating, that I have users that use the app every day since 2012/2013 and send me emails how the use it and for what purpse. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling to create something that people find so useful, that they keep coming back to it for years. Howevery, from a business perspective, paying once a small fee for 10 years of usage and free updates, cannot be sustainable.

Many developers (myself included) have learned this the hard way. That‚Äôs why I designed my second app [Thirstic](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1471500028), a smart water tracker app, from the beginning on as subscription app.

I know, for many, subscription apps feel like ‚Äúrenting software‚Äù. But in reality, also pay-once software is "rented" and has a limited lifespan. The hard truth is that, sooner or later the developer will have to charge for a new version (and abandon the old one) or will go out of business (and the app will be sunset).

Subscription allow developers to charge users that use the app over many years *more* and charge others, that might need it just for a couple of months, *less*. I think this is a pretty good solution.

Because of all this, starting from today, NetSnips will now offer a yearly subscription option for all new users. I do not think that restricting features for existing users is fair and therefore nothing will change for anyone that bought ‚ÄúUnlimited Snippets‚Äù before today: *you can keep using the app without any limitations*.

I‚Äôm grateful for everyone that is using NetSnips since many years. I‚Äôve also learned a lot from all of you that shared their personal NetSnips use case with me over email. Some awesome examples include tracking cherry blossom in Japan and keeping an eye on competing weather forecasts from worldwide meteorologists. 

If this works out, I more than happy to bring NetSnips to the next level ‚Äì my idea list is long and ambitious. Fingers crossed! ü§û
