[NetSnips](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netsnips/id507888242?mt=8) does *not* collect or store any personal information, except for the following data that is indispensable for the functionality of the app and exclusively stored *on your device*:

- All web page snippets and their related information (url, positioning) are stored in a database on your device.
- We are saving the last screenshot of your web page snippets in your local cache directory.
- For every snippet, we might store the associated web page [cookies](http://www.whatarecookies.com) on your device if the selected web page requests to do so and send them back on subsequent snippet updates. This is a similar behaviour as web browsers if you have cookies enabled.

NetSnips sends anonymized data about your in-app purchases and basic app usage information (operating system, country, session count, ...) to our purchase validation service [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy), for the solely purpose to validate your purchases and unlock premium features and identify potential app problems.
